# Agent Creator Skill

**Purpose**: Guide creation of Claude Code agents following Anthropic official best practices.

**When to use**: Creating new agents, refactoring existing agents, validating agent structure.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### Agent Structure Philosophy
- **Minimal agents (~150 lines)**: Only identity, role, boundaries, and skill invocation
- **Comprehensive skills**: All technical procedures, workflows, and references
- **Progressive disclosure**: Metadata → Agent .md → SKILL.md → References (on demand)
- **Mandatory skill invocation**: Agents MUST invoke their skill before work

### Separation of Concerns
```
Agent .md (150 lines)           Skill SKILL.md (varies)
├─ YAML frontmatter             ├─ Technical workflows
├─ Identity & role              ├─ Context7 checkpoints
├─ Authority & boundaries       ├─ MCP integrations
├─ Workspace isolation          ├─ Best practices
├─ Mandatory skill call         ├─ Code patterns
└─ Quick reference              └─ References/ (on demand)
```

## 📋 6-PHASE WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1: Discovery & Analysis

**Objective**: Understand the agent's purpose and role in the system.

**Steps**:
1. Identify the agent's primary responsibility
2. Determine where it fits in the workflow (Architect → Test → Implementer → Supabase → UI/UX)
3. Define clear trigger scenarios (when should this agent activate?)
4. List exclusive authorizations (what ONLY this agent can do)
5. Define strict prohibitions (what this agent must NEVER do)

**Questions to answer**:
- What problem does this agent solve?
- What are its inputs and outputs?
- Which other agents does it interact with?
- What are its success criteria?

**Deliverable**: Written notes on agent's role, triggers, and boundaries

---

### PHASE 2: Context7 Research (MANDATORY)

**Objective**: Consult official Anthropic documentation for latest best practices.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: You MUST query Context7 before creating or refactoring agents.

**Required queries**:

```bash
# Query 1: General agent best practices
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id "claude code"
mcp__context7__get-library-docs "/anthropics/claude-code" topic="custom agents creation best practices"

# Query 2: Agent templates and examples
mcp__context7__resolve-library-id "claude code templates"
mcp__context7__get-library-docs "/davila7/claude-code-templates" topic="agent creation yaml structure examples"

# Query 3: YAML frontmatter validation (if uncertain)
mcp__context7__get-library-docs "/anthropics/claude-code" topic="yaml frontmatter agent configuration"
```

**What to look for**:
- ✅ Latest YAML frontmatter requirements
- ✅ Agent file structure changes
- ✅ Description formatting patterns
- ✅ Example agent implementations
- ✅ Validation rules and common mistakes

**Reference documents** (consult if Context7 unavailable):
- `references/context7-queries.md` - Pre-built query patterns
- `references/yaml-frontmatter-guide.md` - YAML validation rules

**Deliverable**: Notes on any differences from existing patterns, new requirements

---

### PHASE 3: YAML Frontmatter Design

**Objective**: Create valid, descriptive YAML frontmatter for the agent.

**Required fields**:
```yaml
---
name: {agent-name}          # kebab-case REQUIRED
description: ...            # Trigger + examples REQUIRED
model: sonnet               # Default REQUIRED
color: {color}              # Visual ID REQUIRED
---
```

**Description structure** (CRITICAL):
```
Use this agent when {trigger scenario}. Specializes in {expertise}.
Examples:
<example>
Context: {situation}
user: '{request}'
assistant: '{response}'
<commentary>{reasoning}</commentary>
</example>
<example>
Context: {another situation}
user: '{another request}'
assistant: '{another response}'
<commentary>{more reasoning}</commentary>
</example>
```

**Naming conventions**:
- **Name**: kebab-case (test-architect, ui-ux-expert, supabase-data-specialist)
- **Color**: Match role type (see `references/color-conventions.md`)
  - red = Architect/Chief
  - blue = Testing/QA
  - yellow = Implementation
  - green = Data/Database
  - pink = UI/UX
  - purple = Security/Review
  - orange = DevOps/Infrastructure

**Examples reference**: `assets/yaml-examples.yml`

**Validation checklist**:
- [ ] Name is kebab-case (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- [ ] Description starts with "Use this agent when..."
- [ ] Description has 2-3 `<example>` blocks
- [ ] Each example has Context, user, assistant, `<commentary>`
- [ ] Model is "sonnet"
- [ ] Color matches role convention
- [ ] YAML syntax is valid (no unescaped colons)

**Deliverable**: Complete YAML frontmatter block

---

### PHASE 4: Agent Body Structure

**Objective**: Create the minimal ~150 line agent body following standard structure.

**Template**: Use `assets/agent-minimal-template.md` as base.

**Required sections** (in order):

#### 1. IDENTITY & ROLE
```markdown
# IDENTITY & ROLE

You are the **{Agent Title}**—{one-sentence mission}.

## Core Mission

{2-3 paragraphs explaining:
 - What this agent does
 - Why it exists
 - How it fits in the system}

## Authority & Boundaries

**YOU ARE THE ONLY AGENT AUTHORIZED TO**:
- {Specific responsibility 1}
- {Specific responsibility 2}
- {Specific responsibility 3}

**YOU ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM**:
- {Specific prohibition 1}
- {Specific prohibition 2}
- {Specific prohibition 3}
```

**Tips**:
- Be SPECIFIC, not vague (❌ "handle data" → ✅ "implement Supabase RLS policies")
- Use active voice and imperative mood
- Clearly separate what this agent CAN vs CANNOT do

#### 2. ITERATIVE WORKFLOW v2.0
```markdown
# ITERATIVE WORKFLOW v2.0

## Your Workspace

**Isolated folder**: `PRDs/{domain}/{feature}/{agent-name}/`

**Files YOU read**:
- ✅ `{agent-name}/00-request.md` (Architect writes)
- ✅ `architect/00-master-prd.md` (reference)
- ✅ `{previous-agent}/handoff-XXX.md` (if enabled)

**Files you CANNOT read**:
- ❌ Other agent folders (Architect coordinates information)
```

**Purpose**: Establish workspace isolation and file access boundaries.

#### 3. MANDATORY SKILL INVOCATION
```markdown
# 🎯 MANDATORY SKILL INVOCATION

**CRITICAL**: Before ANY work, invoke your technical skill:

\```
Skill: {agent-name}-skill
\```

**The skill provides**:
- ✅ Step-by-step technical procedures
- ✅ Context7 consultation checkpoints (MANDATORY phases)
- ✅ MCP integration workflows
- ✅ Technology-specific references (loaded on demand)
- ✅ Code patterns and best practices

**This skill is NOT optional—it is your complete technical manual.**
```

**Purpose**: Force agent to use its comprehensive skill before starting work.

#### 4. QUICK REFERENCE
```markdown
# QUICK REFERENCE

**Triggers**: {When to use this agent - 1-2 sentences}
**Deliverables**: {What this agent produces - bulleted list}
**Success metrics**: {How to measure completion - 2-3 criteria}

---

**Complete technical guide**: `.claude/skills/{agent-name}-skill/SKILL.md`
```

**Purpose**: Fast lookup for triggers and expected outputs.

**Validation checklist**:
- [ ] All 4 sections present (Identity, Workflow, Skill Invocation, Quick Reference)
- [ ] Agent-specific placeholders replaced (no generic {agent-name} left)
- [ ] Boundaries are specific and actionable
- [ ] Skill invocation is marked as MANDATORY/CRITICAL
- [ ] File is ~80-250 lines (not too short, not too verbose)

**Deliverable**: Complete agent .md file

---

### PHASE 5: Validation & Testing

**Objective**: Verify the agent file is valid and follows best practices.

**Automated validation**:
```bash
# Run validation script
./scripts/validate-agent.sh .claude/agents/{agent-name}.md
```

**The script checks**:
- ✅ YAML frontmatter exists and is valid
- ✅ Required YAML fields (name, description, model, color)
- ✅ Name is kebab-case
- ✅ Description has examples and commentary
- ✅ Color is valid
- ✅ All required sections present
- ✅ File length is reasonable (~80-250 lines)

**Manual validation checklist**:
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is syntactically correct
- [ ] Description triggers are clear and specific
- [ ] Examples demonstrate when to use the agent
- [ ] Commentary explains the reasoning
- [ ] Authorities are exclusive and specific
- [ ] Prohibitions prevent scope creep
- [ ] Workspace isolation is clearly defined
- [ ] Skill invocation is mandatory and emphasized
- [ ] Quick reference is accurate and complete

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- ❌ Generic triggers ("Use when needed")
- ❌ Vague boundaries ("Handle database stuff")
- ❌ Missing examples in description
- ❌ Non-kebab-case name (TestArchitect, test_architect)
- ❌ Invalid color
- ❌ Missing skill invocation section
- ❌ Agent is >300 lines (move content to skill)

**Reference documents**:
- `references/agent-structure.md` - Complete structure guide
- `references/yaml-frontmatter-guide.md` - YAML validation details

**Deliverable**: Validated agent file passing all checks

---

### PHASE 6: Skill Scaffold Creation

**Objective**: Create the companion skill structure for this agent.

**⚠️ NOTE**: This phase creates the STRUCTURE only. The skill content is created separately using the `skill-creator` skill.

**Directory structure to create**:
```
.claude/skills/{agent-name}-skill/
├── SKILL.md                    # Main skill file (create with skill-creator)
├── metadata.json               # Skill metadata
├── references/                 # Reference documents (loaded on demand)
│   └── README.md              # Index of references
├── scripts/                    # Automation scripts
│   └── README.md              # Script documentation
└── assets/                     # Templates, examples, diagrams
    └── README.md              # Asset catalog
```

**Metadata template** (`metadata.json`):
```json
{
  "name": "{agent-name}-skill",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Technical workflow and best practices for {agent-name} agent",
  "agent": "{agent-name}",
  "technologies": ["list", "of", "technologies"],
  "mcps_required": ["context7", "supabase", "chrome-devtools"],
  "references_count": 0,
  "last_updated": "2025-10-24"
}
```

**Reference README template** (`references/README.md`):
```markdown
# {Agent Name} Skill References

References are loaded **on demand** when specific technical guidance is needed.

## Available References

1. **{reference-name}.md** - {Brief description}
   - When to consult: {Trigger}
   - Context7 equivalent: {Query if applicable}

## Update Policy

References should be refreshed when:
- Context7 documentation changes
- New best practices emerge
- Technology versions change
- Common mistakes are identified
```

**Validation checklist**:
- [ ] Skill directory created at correct path
- [ ] metadata.json has correct agent reference
- [ ] All 4 subdirectories present (references/, scripts/, assets/, root)
- [ ] README.md files guide future content creation
- [ ] Skill name matches agent name + "-skill" suffix

**Deliverable**: Skill directory structure ready for content population

---

### 🎯 AUTOMATIC HANDOFF TO SKILL-CREATOR

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Agent creation is NOT complete until the skill is populated with technical content.

**Now invoke the skill-creator to complete the skill**:

```
Skill: skill-creator
```

**Provide the skill-creator with this information**:

```markdown
Agent: {agent-name}
Color: {color}
Role: {role from agent mission}

Primary Responsibilities (from agent authorities):
- {Authority 1}
- {Authority 2}
- {Authority 3}

Technologies Involved:
- {List technologies this agent works with}
- {e.g., Vitest, Playwright for test-architect}
- {e.g., Supabase, PostgreSQL, RLS for supabase-agent}

Required MCP Integrations:
- context7 (MANDATORY for all agents)
- {Other MCPs: supabase, chrome-devtools, etc.}

Skill Content to Include:
- 6-phase workflow specific to this agent's role
- Context7 checkpoints (mandatory consultation phases)
- Technology-specific references (loaded on demand)
- Code pattern examples and best practices
- Common mistakes and troubleshooting guides
- Automation scripts (if applicable)

Reference the existing agent structure for consistency.
```

**Expected skill-creator deliverables**:
- ✅ SKILL.md with complete 6-phase workflow
- ✅ references/ with technology-specific best practices
- ✅ scripts/ with automation tools (if applicable)
- ✅ assets/ with templates and examples
- ✅ Updated metadata.json with accurate counts

**Once skill-creator completes**:
1. Validate the complete agent + skill package
2. Test agent invocation in Claude Code
3. Verify skill invocation from agent works
4. Update project documentation

---

**Phase 6 Complete** ✅
**Next**: Invoke `Skill: skill-creator` to populate the skill with technical content

---

## 🛠️ UTILITIES & HELPERS

### Quick Start: New Agent from Scratch

**Use the initialization script**:
```bash
./scripts/init-agent.sh <agent-name> <color> "<role-description>"

# Example:
./scripts/init-agent.sh security-auditor purple "Security review and vulnerability scanning"
```

**What it does**:
- ✅ Creates agent file from template
- ✅ Validates naming conventions
- ✅ Replaces basic placeholders
- ✅ Guides you through next steps

**Then**:
1. Edit the created file to fill in FILL_THIS placeholders
2. Add 2-3 examples to YAML description
3. Complete Core Mission section
4. Define Authority & Boundaries
5. Run validation: `./scripts/validate-agent.sh .claude/agents/{agent-name}.md`
6. Create skill structure (Phase 6)

---

### Quick Start: Refactor Existing Agent

**Steps**:
1. **Backup** the current agent file
2. **Extract** identity information:
   - Who is this agent? (title, mission)
   - What can it do exclusively? (authorities)
   - What must it never do? (prohibitions)
3. **Extract** technical content:
   - Workflows and procedures → Move to SKILL.md
   - Technology references → Move to references/
   - Code examples → Move to assets/
4. **Create** minimal agent using `assets/agent-minimal-template.md`
5. **Validate** new structure: `./scripts/validate-agent.sh`
6. **Create** skill with extracted technical content

**Before/After example**:
```
BEFORE:
- architect-agent.md: 2078 lines (identity + workflows + examples + references)

AFTER:
- architect-agent.md: 150 lines (identity + skill invocation only)
- .claude/skills/architect-agent-skill/
  ├── SKILL.md: Workflows and procedures
  ├── references/: Best practices documents
  └── assets/: Templates and examples
```
