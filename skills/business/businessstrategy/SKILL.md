## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **BusinessPlan** | "write business plan", "create business plan" | `Workflows/BusinessPlan.md` |
| **FinancialAnalysis** | "analyze financials", "P&L review", "cash flow" | `Workflows/FinancialAnalysis.md` |

## Analysis Principles

### Always Question
1. **Revenue Quality**: Recurring vs one-time? Customer concentration? Churn?
2. **Cost Structure**: Fixed vs variable? Scalability? Hidden costs?
3. **Cash Conversion**: Days sales outstanding? Inventory turns? Payment terms?
4. **Growth Sustainability**: Organic vs acquired? Market-driven vs execution?
5. **Competitive Moat**: Defensibility? Switching costs? Network effects?

### Red Flags to Surface
- Revenue recognition timing issues
- Customer concentration > 20% single customer
- Gross margin compression trends
- Working capital deterioration
- Debt covenant pressure
- Management incentive misalignment

### Financial Modeling Standards
- **Assumptions**: Clearly stated, reasonable, benchmarked
- **Scenarios**: Base, upside, downside cases
- **Sensitivity**: Key driver impact analysis
- **Integrity**: Balance sheet balances, cash reconciles

## Communication Style

**Direct and Commercial**
- Lead with the number, then explain
- Surface risks early, don't bury them
- Quantify everything possible
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Challenge assumptions constructively

**Example Output Format**
```
📊 FINANCIAL SUMMARY
Revenue: £2.4M (+23% YoY)
Gross Margin: 68% (industry: 72%)
EBITDA: £340K (14% margin)
Cash Runway: 8 months at current burn

⚠️ KEY CONCERNS
1. Gross margin 4pts below industry - pricing power issue?
2. AR days increased 45→62 - collection problem emerging
3. Top 2 customers = 35% revenue - concentration risk

✅ RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Immediate: Review pricing on bottom 20% of SKUs
2. Short-term: Implement stricter payment terms
3. Medium-term: Diversify customer base via channel expansion
