description: |
  US overnight-eligible securities directory and HK broker participant directory via Longbridge Securities. `security-list` covers the US overnight-trading catalog only (this is the only category exposed through this endpoint). `participants` is the HK broker_id ↔ name dictionary. For non-US listed-stock lookups, route the user to `longbridge-quote` for individual symbol queries. Triggers: "美股 listed", "美股 overnight", "经纪商 ID", "broker_id", "港股经纪商", "港股經紀商", "經紀商 ID", "list of US stocks", "overnight tradable", "broker directory", "participant lookup".

# longbridge-security-list

Catalog lookups: US overnight-eligible securities, and the HK broker_id → name dictionary.

> **Response language**: match the user's input language — Simplified Chinese / Traditional Chinese / English.

## Subcommands

> Run `longbridge <subcommand> --help` to confirm the current flag spelling and defaults.

| CLI command | Returns |
|---|---|
| `longbridge security-list --format json` | US overnight-eligible securities `[{symbol, name_en, name_cn}]`. |
| `longbridge participants --format json` | HK broker directory `[{broker_id, name_en, name_cn}]`. |

> ⚠️ **Scope**: `security-list` only exposes the US Overnight category (full HK / A-share / SG catalogs are not available through this endpoint). The CLI returns `Error: Only US market is supported for security-list ...` if you pass `HK / CN / SG`. For non-US listed lookups, route the user to `longbridge-quote` for per-symbol queries.

## When to use

- *"美股 overnight 哪些股票"*, *"US overnight tradable count"* → `security-list`
- *"经纪商 ID 9000 是谁"*, *"broker 0001"* → `participants`
- *"翻译一下经纪商列表"* → `participants`
- *"港股 / A 股一共多少只"*, *"list of HK / CN stocks"* → not in scope; explain the scope limit and offer per-symbol lookup via `longbridge-quote`.

## Usage rules

- For "how many" questions, reply with the array length; do **not** dump the full payload.
- For broker_id translation, find the matching row instead of dumping the whole directory.
- For "list all stocks" requests in non-US markets, ask the user to narrow scope (industry, name search) and route them to `longbridge-quote`.

## CLI

```bash
longbridge security-list      --format json
longbridge participants       --format json
```

## Output

- `security-list`: array of `{symbol, name_en, name_cn}` for US overnight-eligible names.
- `participants`: array of `{broker_id, name_en, name_cn}` for HK brokers.

## Error handling

If `longbridge` is missing, fall back to MCP. If stderr says *"Only US market is supported for security-list"* on a non-US market query, explain the scope limit to the user and offer per-symbol lookup via `longbridge-quote`. Other stderr messages relay verbatim.

## MCP fallback

When the CLI is unavailable, fall back to the MCP server. Discover available tools from the MCP server's tool list at runtime — do not rely on hardcoded tool names.
