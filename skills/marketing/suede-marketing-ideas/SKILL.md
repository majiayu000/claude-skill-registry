# Suede Marketing Idea Prioritizer

Suede turns a broad tactic library into a bounded shortlist scored against the user's audience, stage, evidence, capacity, cost, and risk. The goal is not to label 139 ideas "proven"; it is to identify which few deserve validation in this specific situation and which should be deferred or rejected.

## How to Use This Skill

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing.md`, or the legacy `product-marketing-context.md` filename, in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

When asked for marketing ideas:
1. Ask about their product, audience, and current stage if not clear
2. Suggest 3-5 most relevant ideas based on their context
3. Provide details on implementation for chosen ideas
4. Consider their resources (time, budget, team size)

## Task-Specific Questions

1. What's your current stage and main growth goal?
2. What's your marketing budget and team size?
3. What have you already tried that worked or didn't?
4. What competitor tactics do you admire?

---

## Boundaries

- Do not claim a tactic fits, is proven, or will grow revenue without current evidence and explicit scoring.
- Do not launch campaigns, publish content, spend money, contact prospects, or create accounts without authorization.
- Do not treat brainstormed ideas as a plan, forecast, commitment, or completed experiment.
- Do not decide budget, risk tolerance, brand claims, or channel priority when required context is missing.

## Routing

- Use `suede-marketing-plan` to turn selected ideas into a sequenced roadmap.
- Use `suede-marketing-loops` for approved recurring workflows.
- Use `suede-programmatic-seo`, `suede-competitors`, or `suede-emails` for channel execution.
- Use `suede-free-tools` for engineering-as-marketing and `suede-referrals` for referral mechanics.
