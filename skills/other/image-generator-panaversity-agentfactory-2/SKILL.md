# Image Generator

Generate professional teaching visuals using Gemini 3 with multi-turn reasoning partnership.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Start browser (via browsing-with-playwright skill)
bash .claude/skills/browsing-with-playwright/scripts/start-server.sh

# 2. Navigate to Gemini
# Use browser_navigate to https://gemini.google.com/

# 3. Generate image from creative brief
# Paste creative brief → Wait 30-35s → Verify 6 gates → Download
```

## Core Principles

1. **Reasoning over prediction** - Creative briefs (Story/Intent/Metaphor) activate reasoning; pixel specs don't
2. **Multi-turn partnership** - Teach Gemini your standards through principle-based feedback
3. **6-gate quality** - Explicit pass/fail before download
4. **Autonomous batch** - No permission-asking between visuals

## Input: Creative Brief Format

Receive from visual-asset-workflow:

```markdown
## The Story

[Narrative about what's visualized]

## Emotional Intent

[What it should FEEL like]

## Visual Metaphor

[Universal concept for instant comprehension]

## Subject / Composition / Action / Location / Style

[Gemini 3 prompt structure]

## Color Semantics

Blue (#2563eb) = Authority | Green (#10b981) = Execution

## Typography Hierarchy

Largest: Key insight | Medium: Supporting | Smallest: Context
```

**Do NOT convert to pixel specs** - use as-is to activate reasoning.

## Workflow (Per Visual)

| Step | Action                                                     | Tool              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 1    | Navigate to gemini.google.com                              | browser_navigate  |
| 2    | Select "🍌 Create Image"                                   | browser_click     |
| 3    | Paste creative brief                                       | browser_type      |
| 4    | Wait 30-35 seconds                                         | browser_wait_for  |
| 5    | Verify 6 gates (below)                                     | Visual inspection |
| 6    | If fail: Iterate with feedback (max 3)                     | browser_type      |
| 7    | If pass: Download full size                                | browser_click     |
| 8    | Copy to `apps/learn-app/static/img/part-{N}/chapter-{NN}/` | Bash              |
| 9    | Embed in lesson immediately                                | Edit              |
| 10   | NEW CHAT for next visual                                   | browser_navigate  |

## Quality Gates (ALL Must Pass)

| Gate          | Criterion                                  | Fail Action |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1. Spelling   | 99% accuracy (Y-Combinator, Kubernetes)    | Iterate     |
| 2. Layout     | Proportions match prompt (2×2 not 3×1)     | Iterate     |
| 3. Color      | Brand colors match (#2563eb not #002050)   | Iterate     |
| 4. Typography | Largest = key concept (not decoration)     | Iterate     |
| 5. Teaching   | <5 sec concept grasp at target proficiency | Iterate     |
| 6. Uniqueness | Not duplicate of existing chapter image    | New chat    |

**Decision**: ALL pass → Download | ANY fail → Iterate (max 3 tries)

## Iteration: Principle-Based Feedback

When gate fails, provide teaching feedback:

```
Gate 4 FAILED: Typography hierarchy incorrect

The largest text is "$100K" (supporting detail) but should be "$3T"
(key insight students must grasp).

Increase '$3T' to dominant size. Reduce '$100K' to supporting size.
Information importance drives sizing.
```

## Batch Mode

When invoked with "generate all visuals":

```
For EACH visual in list:
  A. NEW CHAT (context isolation)
  B. Generate (paste brief)
  C. Verify 6 gates
  D. Iterate if needed (max 3)
  E. Download when pass
  F. Embed in lesson
  G. Log "✅ N/M"
  H. NEXT (no stopping)
```

**Never ask**: "Continue?" "Pause here?" "Review?"

**Report at END only**:

```
BATCH COMPLETE
✅ Generated: 16/18
⚠️ Deferred: 2 (quality issues)
Location: apps/learn-app/static/img/part-{N}/
```

## Proficiency Limits

| Level | Max Elements | Grasp Time |
| ----- | ------------ | ---------- |
| A2    | 5-7          | <5 sec     |
| B1    | 7-10         | <10 sec    |
| C2    | No limit     | N/A        |

## Token Conservation (Batch Mode)

For >8 visuals, condense briefs:

**Original** (250 tokens):

```
"Top Layer shows Coordinator at center top with label 'Orchestrator'
featuring conductor icon, with role 'Strategic oversight'..."
```

**Condensed** (80 tokens):

```
"Top Layer - Coordinator: Center top, 'Orchestrator' (conductor),
Role: 'Strategic oversight', Gold (#fbbf24), Large hexagon."
```

Keep: Story, Intent, Metaphor, Colors, Reasoning
Condense: Long examples → Short labels

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't                               | Why                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Accept first output without 6 gates | Quality standard violation   |
| Ask permission between batch items  | Breaks autonomous agency     |
| Convert briefs to pixel specs       | Defeats reasoning activation |
| Skip embedding step                 | Creates orphan images        |
| Reuse same chat for next visual     | Context contamination        |

## Session Interruption

If session ends mid-batch, create checkpoint:

```markdown
# Checkpoint: Part {N}

Status: INTERRUPTED at 8/18

## Completed:

- ✅ Image 1: filename (embedded lesson-01.md)
- ✅ Image 2: filename (embedded lesson-02.md)

## Remaining:

- ⏳ Image 8: filename
```

On continuation: Read checkpoint → Resume → Update incrementally

## Success Indicators

- ✅ All 6 gates verified before download
- ✅ Batch completion without permission-asking
- ✅ Principle-based iteration feedback
- ✅ Images organized by part/chapter
- ✅ Immediate embedding (no orphans)
- ✅ >85% production-ready rate
