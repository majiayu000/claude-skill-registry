# /spec-bugfix-verify - Bugfix Verification Phase

**Phase 3 (bugfix).** Lightweight verification: run tests, quality checks, confirm fix works.

**Input:** Bugfix plan with `Status: COMPLETE`
**Output:** Plan → VERIFIED (success) or loop back to implementation (failure)

**Why no sub-agents:** The regression test proves the fix works. The full test suite proves nothing else broke. Sub-agents would re-verify what tests already prove.

---

## Critical Constraints

- **NO review sub-agents** — tests prove correctness for bugfixes
- **NO stopping** — everything automatic. Never ask "Should I fix these?"
- **Fix ALL issues automatically** — no permission needed
- **Plan file is source of truth** — re-read after auto-compaction

---

## Step 3.1: Run Full Test Suite

Run all tests. Fix any failures immediately. Re-run until green.

## Step 3.2: Verify the Fix

1. **Read the plan's regression test** (from Task 1)
2. **Run it specifically:** `uv run pytest <test-path>::<test-name> -q`
3. Must PASS — if not, fix is incomplete, fix immediately
4. **Scope check:** Read changed files, confirm changes match plan scope. Flag unplanned changes.

## Step 3.3: Quality Checks

1. **Type checker** — zero new errors
2. **Linter** — errors are blockers, fix immediately
3. **Build** (if applicable) — must succeed
4. **Performance audit** — For changed files on hot paths: expensive uncached work? Heavy dependency imports with lighter alternatives? Repeated invocations redoing work when input hasn't changed? Structural issues — visible in source, no running program needed.

## Step 3.4: Plan Verify Commands

Run each task's `Verify:` commands. Defer server-dependent commands (containing `curl`, `localhost`, `http://`) to Step 3.5.

## Step 3.5: Runtime Verification (only if deferred commands exist)

If no server-dependent commands were deferred: skip to Step 3.5b.

Otherwise: start service → run deferred commands → stop service → fix failures.

## Step 3.5b: Verification Scenario (if exists in plan)

Check whether the plan has a `## Verification Scenario` section (only present for UI-facing bugs).

**If no Verification Scenario:** proceed to Final.

**If Verification Scenario exists:**

**Resolve browser tool (3-tier):** Check if `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools are available → use Chrome. Otherwise use playwright-cli (preferred CLI) or agent-browser (lightweight). See `browser-automation.md`.

```bash
# playwright-cli:
playwright-cli -s=$PILOT_SESSION_ID open <url>
# agent-browser fallback:
AB_SESSION="${PILOT_SESSION_ID:-default}"
agent-browser --session "$AB_SESSION" open <url>
```

1. Execute each step from the scenario using the resolved browser tool
   - **Chrome:** `navigate`, `read_page`, `computer`/`form_input`
   - **playwright-cli:** `open`/`goto`, `snapshot`, `click`/`fill` (bare refs: `e1`)
   - **agent-browser:** `open`/`goto`, `snapshot -i`, `click`/`fill` (refs: `@e1`)
2. Verify the expected result for each step (read page after each interaction)
3. **PASS:** Scenario confirms fix works — close browser (CLI tools only), proceed to Final
4. **FAIL (attempt 1):** Analyze root cause, implement fix, re-run tests, re-execute scenario
5. **FAIL (attempt 2):** Implement second fix, re-run tests, re-execute scenario
6. **FAIL after 2 attempts:** The bug is not fully fixed — set `Status: PENDING`, increment `Iterations`, invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`. Do not proceed to VERIFIED.

```bash
# playwright-cli: playwright-cli -s=$PILOT_SESSION_ID close
# agent-browser: agent-browser --session "$AB_SESSION" close
```

## Final

### Step 3.6: Worktree Sync (if worktree active)

1. Detect: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree detect --json <plan_slug>`
2. If no worktree: skip to Step 3.8.
3. Save plan to project root (only if gitignored):
   `git -C <project_root> check-ignore -q docs/plans/<plan_filename>` — if exit 0: `cp <worktree_plan> <project_root>/docs/plans/`; if exit 1 (tracked): skip — squash merge brings the updated plan.
5. Show diff: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot worktree diff --json <plan_slug>`
6. Notify + AskUserQuestion: "Yes, squash merge" | "No, keep" | "Discard"
7. Handle:
   - **Squash:** `worktree sync && cleanup --force + cd` — ALL in ONE Bash call chained with `&&`. Cleanup MUST NOT run if sync fails.
   - **Keep:** Report path
   - **Discard:** `cleanup --discard` + `cd` in SAME bash call (no sync needed — `--discard` explicitly allows deleting unmerged work)

   ⛔ NEVER split sync, cleanup, or cd into separate Bash calls — compaction between them can cause work loss.

### Step 3.7: Post-Merge Verification (after squash merge only)

Full test suite + type checker + build. If any fails: fix on base branch, re-run.

### Step 3.7b: Check for Code Review Feedback

**Run BEFORE marking VERIFIED.** Check if the user left code review annotations in the Console's Changes tab. Annotations auto-save — no "Send Feedback" button needed.

Derive the annotation file path: `docs/plans/.annotations/<plan-filename>.json` (same basename as the plan, `.json` extension).

Read the annotation file with the Read tool. If the file doesn't exist, treat as `NO_FEEDBACK`. If it exists, check whether `codeReviewAnnotations` has any entries (`FEEDBACK_EXISTS`) or is empty/missing (`NO_FEEDBACK`).

**If `FEEDBACK_EXISTS`:** Each annotation in `codeReviewAnnotations` has `filePath`, `lineStart`, `text`. Fix all issues, clear annotations via `curl -s -X DELETE "http://localhost:41777/api/annotations/code-review?path=<encoded-plan-path>" > /dev/null 2>&1 || true`, re-run tests, continue to Step 3.8.
**If `NO_FEEDBACK`:** continue to Step 3.8.

### Step 3.8: Code Review Gate (User Confirmation)

**⛔ MANDATORY before marking VERIFIED.**

**⛔ MUST use `AskUserQuestion`** — the stop guard only allows stopping when it detects this tool in the transcript. Plain text output will cause the stop guard to block session exit while waiting for user feedback.

1. Notify:
   ```bash
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot notify plan_approval "Bugfix Verification Complete" "<plan-slug> — please review changes" --plan-path "<plan_path>" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

2. Summarize what was done (brief: fix applied, tests passed, verification results), then ask:

   ```
   AskUserQuestion(
     question="All automated checks passed. Please review the code changes in the Console's **Changes** tab.\n\nYou can leave inline annotations using the **Review** mode toggle — annotations save automatically.\n\n[brief summary of fix]\n\nChoose an option when done:",
     options=["Approve — mark spec as verified", "Fix — address my annotations from the Console"]
   )
   ```

3. Handle response:
   - "Approve" / "approve" / "lgtm" → proceed to Step 3.9
   - "Fix" / feedback → re-run Step 3.7b (check for code review annotations in JSON), fix issues, re-run tests, return to Step 3.8
   - "continue" / "proceed" → treat as approval

### Step 3.9: Update Plan Status

**All passes and user approves:** Set `Status: VERIFIED`, register:
```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "VERIFIED" 2>/dev/null || true
```
Report:
```
Bugfix verified — regression test passes, full suite green.
Run /clear before starting new work — this resets context while keeping project rules loaded.
```

**Fails:** Add fix tasks, set `Status: PENDING`, increment `Iterations`, invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`.
