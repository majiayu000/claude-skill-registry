## Web Speech API

### Browser Implementation

See `skills/adventure/dist/speech.js` for full implementation.

```javascript
// Initialize
const speech = new SpeechSystem();
await speech.ready;

// Speak
speech.speak("Hello, adventurer!");
speech.speakRobot("RESISTANCE IS FUTILE");
speech.speakEffect("*magical sounds*");

// With options
speech.speak("Welcome!", {
    voiceType: 'female',
    language: 'en-GB',
    pitch: 1.2,
    rate: 0.9
});

// Character persistence
const guardVoice = speech.selectVoice({ gender: 'male' });
speech.speakWithVoice("Halt!", guardVoice);
speech.speakWithVoice("You may pass.", guardVoice);
```

### Voice Classification

The `VoiceDatabase` class classifies voices by:

- **Type**: human, effect, robot
- **Gender**: male, female, neutral
- **Age**: child, adult, elderly
- **Language**: BCP 47 codes (en-US, fr-FR, etc.)
- **Local/Remote**: Local voices vs. network voices

### Single Source of Truth

All voice classification data lives in **`voices/browser-voices.yml`**:

```yaml
# Blacklisted voices (known problematic)
blacklist:
  - name: "Daniel (French (France))"
    reason: "Known problematic voice"

# Effect voices (non-human)
types:
  effect:
    regex: "^(Bells|Zarvox|Trinoids|Whisper|...)$"

# Gender detection tokens
gender:
  female:
    tokens: [alice, amélie, samantha, ...]
  male:
    tokens: [aaron, daniel, ralph, ...]

# Character archetype recommendations
character_archetypes:
  wise_elder: { voice: Grandma, rate: 170 }
  robot_menacing: { voice: Zarvox, rate: 100 }
```

The JS code is generated from this YAML. To update voice classification, edit the YAML and rebuild.

## Speech Recognition

### Browser (SpeechRecognitionSystem)

See `skills/adventure/dist/recognition.js` for full implementation.

```javascript
// Initialize
const recognition = new SpeechRecognitionSystem({
    language: 'en-US',
    continuous: false
});

// Listen for single phrase
const text = await recognition.listen();
console.log('You said:', text);

// Continuous listening
recognition.onResult = (transcript) => {
    console.log('Final:', transcript);
};
recognition.onInterim = (transcript) => {
    console.log('Interim:', transcript);
};
recognition.startListening();

// Command recognition
const result = await recognition.listenForCommands([
    'go north', 'look', 'take sword'
]);
if (result.command) {
    engine.command(result.command);
}
```

### Browser Support

| Browser | Support | Privacy |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Chrome | ✅ | ⚠️ Sends to Google |
| Safari | ✅ | May be on-device |
| Firefox | ❌ | Disabled by default |
| Edge | ❌ | Not supported |

### Native Platform Shortcuts

| Platform | Shortcut | Feature |
|----------|----------|---------|
| macOS | Fn Fn | Dictation |
| Windows | Win + H | Voice Typing |
| iOS | 🎤 on keyboard | Dictation |
| Android | 🎤 on keyboard | Voice Typing |

### Whisper (OpenAI)

```bash
# Using whisper.cpp (local)
whisper --model base.en audio.wav

# Using OpenAI API
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -F model="whisper-1" \
  -F file="@audio.mp3"
```

## Personal Voice (macOS)

⚠️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** — See TODO in CARD.yml

### Known Limitations

1. **Apple Silicon only** (M1, M2, M3)
2. **Doesn't appear in `say -v ?`** — Must know exact name
3. **No `-o` flag support** — Can't save to file directly
4. **Privacy restricted** — May need special permissions

### Creating Personal Voice

1. System Settings → Accessibility → Personal Voice
2. Record 15+ minutes of phrases
3. Processing takes 15-60 minutes
4. Find voice name in Spoken Content settings

### Workarounds

- [SavePersonalVoiceAudio](https://github.com/limneos/SavePersonalVoiceAudio) — Extract Personal Voice audio
- Shortcuts app — Can use Personal Voice with "Speak" action
- Record system audio while speaking

---

## Integration with Adventure

The adventure runtime uses the speech skill:

```javascript
// Create speaking adventure
const engine = createSpeakingAdventure('adventure', {
    speechEnabled: true,
    speakRooms: true,
    speakResponses: true
});

// Rooms speak their descriptions
// Characters have persistent voices
// AI entities use robot voices
// Effects use novelty voices
```

See: `skills/adventure/dist/adventure-speech.js`

## aQuery Heritage

This skill is part of extracting **aQuery** (jQuery for Accessibility) into MOOLLM skills:

| aQuery Component | MOOLLM Skill |
|------------------|--------------|
| Speech synthesis | `speech/` |
| Speech recognition | `speech/` |
| Screen reader support | *(planned)* |
| Keyboard navigation | *(planned)* |
| Focus management | *(planned)* |
| ARIA utilities | *(planned)* |
