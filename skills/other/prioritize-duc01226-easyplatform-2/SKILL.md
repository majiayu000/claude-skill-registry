> **[IMPORTANT]** Use `TaskCreate` to break ALL work into small tasks BEFORE starting — including tasks for each file read. This prevents context loss from long files. For simple tasks, AI may ask user whether to skip.

## Quick Summary

**Goal:** Order 3+ backlog items using RICE, MoSCoW, or Value-Effort frameworks with scores and rationale.

**Workflow:**

1. **Collect Items** — Read from files or parse inline list (minimum 3 items)
2. **Select Framework** — RICE (quantitative), MoSCoW (stakeholder alignment), Value-Effort (quick decision)
3. **Score Each Item** — Apply framework criteria and calculate scores
4. **Rank and Report** — Output prioritized table with rationale and recommendations

**Key Rules:**

- Minimum 3 items required; fewer than 3 should be discussed directly
- Default to RICE if unsure; ask user if ambiguous
- Optionally update PBI file priority fields after ranking

# Backlog Prioritization

Order backlog items using data-driven prioritization frameworks to produce a ranked list with scores and rationale.

## When to Use

- Sprint planning needs an ordered backlog (3+ items to rank)
- Stakeholders need a priority ranking with justification
- Feature roadmap ordering with objective criteria
- Comparing competing features or initiatives

## When NOT to Use

- Fewer than 3 items (just discuss directly)
- Creating PBIs or writing stories -- use `product-owner` or `story`
- Full product strategy -- use `product-owner`
- Project status tracking -- use `project-manager`

## Prerequisites

- A list of 3+ backlog items (PBIs, features, or user stories)
- IF items exist as files: read from `team-artifacts/pbis/` or user-provided path
- IF items provided inline: use the provided descriptions

## Workflow

1. **Collect items** to prioritize
    - IF file path provided -> read items from files
    - IF inline list -> parse items from user message
    - IF fewer than 3 items -> ask user for more or suggest direct discussion

2. **Select framework** using decision tree:

    ```
    IF quantitative data available (reach, metrics)  -> RICE
    IF stakeholder alignment needed (must/should/could) -> MoSCoW
    IF quick decision needed (2 axes only)            -> Value-Effort 2x2
    IF user specifies framework                       -> use that framework
    IF unsure                                         -> ask user, default RICE
    ```

3. **Score each item** using selected framework:

    **RICE:**

    ```
    Score = (Reach x Impact x Confidence) / Effort

    Reach:      Users affected per quarter (number)
    Impact:     0.25 (minimal) | 0.5 (low) | 1 (medium) | 2 (high) | 3 (massive)
    Confidence: 0.5 (low) | 0.8 (medium) | 1.0 (high)
    Effort:     Person-months (number)
    ```

    **MoSCoW:**

    ```
    Must Have:   Critical for release, non-negotiable
    Should Have: Important but not vital, workarounds exist
    Could Have:  Desirable, include if capacity allows
    Won't Have:  Out of scope for this cycle
    ```

    **Value-Effort 2x2:**

    ```
    High Value + Low Effort  = Quick Wins    (do first)
    High Value + High Effort = Strategic     (plan carefully)
    Low Value  + Low Effort  = Fill-ins      (if time permits)
    Low Value  + High Effort = Time Sinks    (avoid)
    ```

4. **Rank items** by score (descending for RICE, category for MoSCoW, quadrant for V-E)

5. **Output** prioritized list with scores and rationale

6. **IF PBI files exist** -> optionally update priority field in frontmatter (numeric 1-999)

## Output Format

```markdown
## Prioritized Backlog

**Framework:** [RICE | MoSCoW | Value-Effort]
**Date:** [YYMMDD]
**Items scored:** [count]

### Rankings

| Rank | Item      | Score | Rationale                                           |
| ---- | --------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Feature A | 45.0  | High reach (5000), high impact (3), high confidence |
| 2    | Feature B | 12.0  | Medium reach (2000), medium impact, low effort      |
| 3    | Feature C | 2.5   | Low reach, minimal impact, high effort              |

### Recommendations

- **Do first:** [top items]
- **Plan next:** [medium items]
- **Defer:** [low items with reasoning]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: RICE scoring of 5 features

**Input:** "Prioritize: SSO login, dark mode, export to PDF, email notifications, bulk import"

**Output:**

| Rank | Feature             | Reach | Impact | Conf | Effort | RICE |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----- | ------ | ---- | ------ | ---- |
| 1    | Email notifications | 5000  | 2      | 0.8  | 1      | 8000 |
| 2    | SSO login           | 2000  | 3      | 0.8  | 3      | 1600 |
| 3    | Bulk import         | 500   | 2      | 1.0  | 1      | 1000 |
| 4    | Export to PDF       | 1000  | 1      | 0.8  | 2      | 400  |
| 5    | Dark mode           | 3000  | 0.5    | 0.5  | 2      | 375  |

### Example 2: MoSCoW categorization

**Input:** "Categorize for Q1 release: payment gateway, admin dashboard redesign, API rate limiting, user avatars, audit logs"

**Output:**

- **Must Have:** Payment gateway (revenue-critical), API rate limiting (security)
- **Should Have:** Audit logs (compliance, workaround exists with manual exports)
- **Could Have:** Admin dashboard redesign (improves efficiency but current works)
- **Won't Have:** User avatars (nice-to-have, defer to Q2)

**IMPORTANT Task Planning Notes (MUST FOLLOW)**

- Always plan and break work into many small todo tasks
- Always add a final review todo task to verify work quality and identify fixes/enhancements
